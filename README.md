# MyPythonProject
Project -1 
I have completed a Industrial Training of Programming with python from Internshala where I build a project of GUI Application for Book seller/Shopkeeper.  In this I apply my knowledge of using PyQt and SQLite database to develop a GUI  for a Python application.

In this Project a book shopkeeper uses this application for his ease to search a price and author of a book and print the bill of his customer.

How this Application works?
This application takes Book name and by pressing the 'Find Price' button the Price of that book will be shown to him. By knowing the how much copies or quantity will buy his customer, this application will show the total cost.
To finalize that book the shopkeep has to click on 'Add Item' and then click to 'Pay' button to print his customer's bill. If customer willing to buy more books, the shopkeeper simply enter details of new book and get details. Then the total final cost will shown to him, to get the bill of all the books he has to click on 'Pay' button.
